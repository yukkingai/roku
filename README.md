This version is only included part 1 of the project, and it focuses on our design and layout on the APP we create for customers. Working on layout of this APP and style that have been decided, and it is under image folder which shows its final user interface. For creating better user experience, all pages and theme will be matched with our starry sky style and a dark theme layout when users think about movies, design details are stated in google doc below.

For development of this Roku APP, it is at the stage of research, plan-out and preparation. Template folders and branches are made for upcoming updates.
